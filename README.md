# Secure-scan
The project uses data manipulation, storage and visualisation with the help of
MySQL and python.
This project is a phone submission and collection system for schools using a
Raspberry Pi and RFID technology. This project can provide several benefits to
schools. One of the main advantages is the automation of the phone submission
and collection process. By using RFID technology with a Raspberry Pi, the system
can quickly and accurately identify students using their ID cards, and track the
phones they are submitting or collecting. This eliminates the need for manual
processes such as writing student details in a book, which can be time-
consuming and prone to errors.
Another advantage of the project is the ability to store data electronically,
which allows for easy access and retrieval of information. This can be useful for
school administrators who need to track phone submissions and collections, as
well as for maintaining records of student activity. Additionally, the data can be
used for analysis and reporting, which can help schools to improve their security
and management.
In summary, this project can help schools to streamline their phone submission
and collection process, improve data accuracy and accessibility, and facilitate
security and management.

Prereq: Raspberry pi model 3 with RFID module E-18
